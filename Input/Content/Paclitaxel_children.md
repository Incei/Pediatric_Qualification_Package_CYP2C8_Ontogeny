### Paclitaxel model

Paclitaxel PBPK predictions in children were evaluated using pharmacokinetic (PK) data reported in the following studies: 

- Doz F, Gentet JC, Pein F, Frappaz D, Chastagner P, Moretti S, Vassal G, Arditti J, Tellingen OV, Iliadis A, Catalin J. Phase I trial and pharmacological study of a 3-hour paclitaxel infusion in children with refractory solid tumours: a SFOP study. Br J Cancer. 2001 Mar 2;84(5):604-10.
- Horton TM, Ames MM, Reid JM, Krailo MD, Pendergrass T, Mosher R, Reaman GH, Seibel NL; Children's Oncology Group. A Phase 1 and pharmacokinetic clinical trial of paclitaxel for the treatment of refractory leukemia in children: a Children's Oncology Group study. Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Apr;50(4):788-92.
- Sonnichsen DS, Hurwitz CA, Pratt CB, Shuster JJ, Relling MV. Saturable pharmacokinetics and paclitaxel pharmacodynamics in children with solid tumors. J Clin Oncol. 1994 Mar;12(3):532-8.

The pediatric PBPK model predicted the clearance values of paclitaxel observed in pediatric studies reasonably across all available age groups, ranging from 9 to 11.7 years old. The ratios of mean predicted over observed area under the observed plasma concentrations (AUC) are illustrated in the table below as well as in the predicted versus observed AUC ratio plot, showing that most predictions in children were within 2-fold error of observed values.
