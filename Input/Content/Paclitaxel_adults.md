### Paclitaxel model

Paclitaxel is antimicrotubule agent that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilizes microtubules by preventing depolymerization. It is applied as chemotherapy medication for treating a number of types of cancer. It is administered intravenously. Paclitaxel is mainly metabolized by CYP2C8 [1].  The final Paclitaxel model applies metabolism by CYP2C8, and  CYP3A4,[1] and glomerular filtration [2]. As paclitaxel is highly lipophilic and freely enters the cell without a transporter.[1] Although *in vitro* it is indicated that OATP transporters are involved, this is considered minor and is not included in the model. During model building and the estimation of in vivo clearances of the enzymes, in order to keep the mass balance information as published in vitro, the enzyme-clearances were estimated as factor to the in vitro values with the same ratio. The paclitaxel PBPK model adequately described the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in adults.

The paclitaxel model  was developed using data of the following publications:
